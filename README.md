# ProjetIntegrationRobotique_3ASRI
Robotics Integration Project's goal was to simulate an object's quality control in a simulation environment for a 6 axis collaborative robot MOTOMAN HC10 present in the MFJA labs in Toulouse.
Simulating an object's quality control done automaticly by a robot equipped with a 3D camera is at the same time an introduction to an upcoming new project. 
During this project following software has been used to ensure correct functionning of the HC10 robot : RViz, MoveIt, Gazeboo.

An instruction on how to set up the environment and run the simulation will be provided soon.
